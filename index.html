                  It’s taken just four years for Blackpink to become one of the biggest girl bands in the world.

                  <li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i> With members Jennie, Jisoo, Rosé and Lisa continuing to smash new records and forge new ground</li>
                  <li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i> They were the first K-pop girl group to play at Coachella and to reach 1 billion YouTube views</li>

                <p align="justify">
                  In 2019, they broke three Guinness World Records with the single “Kill This Love”, which has had more than 312 million plays on Spotify and over 824 million YouTube views — a mere fraction of the quartet’s billions of streams, downloads, views and followers.
                  That same year they also undertook the most financially successful concert tour by a Korean female group. They’ve been front-row fixtures at runway shows and the faces of mega brands including Chanel, Puma, Louis Vuitton and Dior. And all this with just a handful of songs in their repertoire.

                    <h4>Lisa (Lalisa "Pranpriya" Manoban)</h4>
                    <p align="justify">Lisa, the youngest member — known as “maknae” — is the main dancer in Blackpink. Born and raised in Thailand, Lisa was in a dance crew at a young age before she auditioned to become a K-pop idol trainee. Besides Thai, Lisa speaks Korean — which she started to learn after moving to South Korea in 2011 — English, Japanese, and basic Chinese. Although she raps and sings, it is the “focused camera” recordings of Lisa’s dancing, a combination of smooth body rolls, sharp hits and captivating facial expressions, that often become the subject of Blackpink’s viral videos.</p>

                    <h4>Jennie (Jennie Kim)</h4>
                    <p align="justify">Blackpink’s main rapper, who also sings, Jennie was a “trainee” for just shy of six years — the longest of the members. (Under the trainee system in South Korea, aspiring pop idols audition with entertainment agencies to become trainees with the hopes of one day debuting as an artist.) Jennie lived in New Zealand for a period before moving back to South Korea in 2010, and speaks fluent English in addition to Korean and Japanese. She was the first member of Blackpink to release an individual track, titled “SOLO.” The music video showcased her versatility as both a rapper and singer, while further establishing her as a fashion icon through the more than 20 outfits worn within the three-minute clip.</p>

                    <h4>Rosé (Park Chaeyoung)</h4>
                    <p align="justify">Born in New Zealand and raised in Australia — where she participated in YG Entertainment’s auditions and placed first — Rosé is also fluent in English. She is the group’s main singer, and her distinct voice is easy to recognize. Rosé plays the guitar and piano and frequently covers both English and Korean songs. She recently shared a cover of Halsey’s “Eyes Closed” on her birthday as a gift to fans, writing, “This is such a deep song and I remember at the time when I recorded it, I was needing some of the healing that this song brings to me. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did singing it.”</p>

                    <h4>Jisoo (Kim Jisoo)</h4>
                    <p align="justify">The oldest member in the group, Jisoo is a singer, often referred to as Blackpink’s mood-maker. She has a quirky sense of humor and a proclivity for generating on-the-spot songs about any topic — from the weather to a craving for chicken skewers. Jisoo acted in a number of music videos and commercials in her pre-Blackpink years. Although she is the only member who does not speak English fluently, the vocalist is nevertheless trilingual, able to speak Korean, Japanese and Chinese.</p>

                <h3>Why Stan <strong>BLACKPINK?</strong></h3>
                <p align="justify">
                  The highlight of Blackpink’s comeback however was the music video for ‘How You Like That’ breaking the YouTube record for the most-viewed music video premiere of all time, with more than 82 million views within the first 24 hours. It’s clear to see that Blackpink have returned once again to take over the world with their latest song, and there’s no better time than now to stan one of the world’s biggest girl groups. So to help you get ready for their album release in September, here are 5 reasons to stan Blackpink! <i>"Source: <a href="https://thehoneypop.com/2020/06/28/how-you-like-that-5-reasons-why-you-should-stan-blackpink/">thehoneypop</a>"</i>

                        Just a few years into their career, Blackpink had already become a household name. They became the first KPOP girl group to perform at Coachella, where they wowed crowds and showed the world the artistry that they had to offer.

                    <div id="accordion-list-2" class="collapse" data-bs-parent=".accordion-list">
                      <p align="justify">
                        Despite their worldwide acclaim, breaking countless records and captivating audiences all across the globe, Blackpink were (and still are) significantly held back from reaching their true potential. After almost 4 years together as a group, Blackpink only have 14 original songs to their name (so far). Not to mention, even though they will be releasing a full album towards the end of this year, we can’t help but feel like it’s been long overdue. Blackpink are artists of such high caliber that their fans are always desiring more content (and we can’t blame them), however, YG Entertainment has been less than willing to provide.
                        Although their first world tour, Blackpink World Tour (In Your Area) demonstrated Blackpink’s immense talent and stage presence, fans weren’t able to get a truly complete and immersive Blackpink experience. The concert setlist included vocal and dance covers of songs including ‘Clarity’ by Zedd, ‘I Like It’ by Cardi B, Bad Bunny, and J Balvin, ‘Attention’ by Charlie Puth, ‘Let It Be’ by the Beatles, and ‘Swalla’ by Jason Derulo.<br> Even though Blackpink flawlessly executed all of these songs, it left us hungry for more songs that the girl group could truly call their own. The fact that Blackpink has managed to gain so many fans and achieve so much success in such a short time span and with a severely lacking catalog of songs is nothing short of inspiring. The girls have truly made the best of what little they were left to work with, and for that reason alone, we have no other choice but to stan.

                        Part of what makes Blackpink so unique is their global appeal, due to the fact that each and every one of the members comes from a diverse background. Jisoo was born in South Korea, as was Jennie; however, Jennie also lived and studied in New Zealand for a few years. Meanwhile, Rosé was born in New Zealand and grew up in Australia, and last but not least, Lisa is from Thailand. Due to some of the members living and studying abroad, most of them speak English fluently, which allows them to connect more easily with their international fanbase. <br> Together, all four members speak a variety of languages and their different upbringings have helped shape the group’s experiences and who they are as artists. They are able to overcome a lot of language barriers and as a result, reach a more widespread audience. Each individual member is truly special and distinct on their own, but when they work together as a team, they are unstoppable, and it is no surprise that people from all over the world are obsessed with them.

                        Blackpink would not be where they are today if it wasn’t for the hard work of their extremely loyal and dedicated fans, the blinks. They’ve stood by the girls’ sides through the hiatuses and lack of music and they’re not afraid of fighting back to defend the group or to demand better treatment from YG. <br> In December 2019 blinks drove a truck around the area where YG Entertainment resides with a list of demands, including that the company give Blackpink 2 comebacks a year with promotion, allow the group to take part in end of year award shows and demanding that they release the other 3 members’ solo music (the company had stated they would release solo projects for the remaining members after Jennie released her song ‘Solo’ back in 2018).

                        There are so many different girl groups out there that are all insanely talented, but what makes Blackpink stand out is that their stage presence is on a completely different level. They have an undeniable aura of confidence and charisma that exudes from each member as soon as they step on the stage. You could say that they light up the sky and shine like the stars, because no one can cover a Blackpink song and pull it off as well as the original group. <br> Their every note, rap line, and dance move is perfectly executed in a way where they completely dominate the room. In every performance that they give, they make sure to provide an unforgettable show. It feels like each member was born to be an entertainer, and when you put all of these superstars together, you get the ultimate girl group.

                    We need to believe we'll become the one that we want to become. For example, if we want to be attractive, first we must believe that we are very attractive. Whether you believe in opportunities or not, if it's not the right time for you, it will come someday.

                    If you want to love yourself, what should come first? Yourself. However, if you do something for others, it can turn out that it is also for you. If you make concessions to others, don't ask why you bother to do so. Just think it is also for you and you won't find it unfair.
